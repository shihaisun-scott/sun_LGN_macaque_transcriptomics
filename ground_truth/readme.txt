# Description
Test the global optimization analysis on known ground truth data (PBMC immune cells - pbmc_900.rds)

The data was provided by the work (Wang, J., Agarwal, D., Huang, M., Hu, G., Zhou, Z., Ye, C., & Zhang, N. R. (2019). Data denoising with transfer learning in single-cell transcriptomics. Nature methods, 16(9), 875-878.), which was initially downsampled from (Zheng, G. X., Terry, J. M., Belgrader, P., Ryvkin, P., Bent, Z. W., Wilson, R., ... & Bielas, J. H. (2017). Massively parallel digital transcriptional profiling of single cells. Nature communications, 8(1), 14049.).
